They bought you a boy? You were rich.	Oh, boy, the car's right here, and you can't even use it. That's like me having you two for waitresses.	6
Caroline, can I ask you a favor?	You're not using the car to propose to Sophie.	2

Are you Googling "Ride-or-die kind of bitch"?	I would be, but I only have two bars.	2
You're hoarding nickels, and I'm walking out of the 99 Cent Store empty-handed? Now I'm mad.	Get ready.	5
What'd you do? Fart us out of the ditch?	Seriously, Caroline, step on it.	5
Should we Thelma and Louise it?	You mean drive over a cliff?	5
Did you girls get the car back in time this morning?	Yep, just in time, thanks to Caroline.	1

You mind if I use your stomach as a tray so I can eat while we do it?	Do I ever mind?	2
Do I ever mind?	I have to block out so much now just to get through the day.	6
Okay, Max, this time can you do the blow-it-up hand thing with him? I've tried it, but I'm just not good at hand stuff. Ask anyone at Yale PREP.	Just give it a shot! You also thought you couldn't eat food that's been stepped on.	5
Is there a class I can take?	I'll go get the last of the rent money.	5
So, what kind of name is "Mookie"? Is it short for something? Long for something? Max, hurry up, girl.	Okay, you should have $800 and here's the last of it.	6
You've been overcharging me rent?	It's not like that.	4
And is Max Black even your real name?	It's a real name.	4
Can you just let this go? So I took a little off the top. Everybody takes a little off the top. Look what God did to Han.	Don't drag me into the middle of Pretty Little Liars.	5
Why? So we can be eye level?	Good put-down, Caroline.	2
See, Han? Teamwork.	All right, listen to our latest Yelp reviews.	1

What? Us beating the crap out of you?	Together, of course.	1
Now let me get this straight. Y'all are volunteering to be locked up in a tiny room? See now, that's some white people stuff right there.	It's a fun way for us all to learn how to work together to solve a problem.	1
Do I have to escape from this too? I mean, is this part of the game?	Is this a bad time to tell you your horse masterminded the whole thing?	1
Is this a bad time to tell you your horse masterminded the whole thing?	Before we start, I need to collect your phones so you can't Google answers.	5
This is a work team-building thing and you're not part of the team. Right, Han?	- She can stay.	2
Is this our version of make-up sex?	I can't see a thing!	5
I used to think that. You know where that got me? Pennsylvania, with no car.	Schwarzenegger's is big, Fox's is small.	6
Oh, come on, are you still on the money? Oh, my God, my sister lost both her thumbs in a combine accident and she didn't talk about it this much.	Ah, here's $25. Let's call it hush money, so hush.	6
The fat twins? 'Cause that made no sense and they look like they get stoned a lot.	Okay, Oleg, drop your pants.	5
Can we have a little more class and wait till we get in the cab?	What? We're gonna do it on top of teacups. That's pretty classy.	2
You know what? Spray some of that stuff in my eyes.	Max, look.	6
Are you okay?	Yeah, I think. 	1
I jumped into a floor hole for feelings?	Well, my feelings are really hurt, Max. It's been four years.	1

You mean here... where you cite precedent?	Mm-hmm.	1
Are you suing him for his love?	I told you it wasn't ready. 	1

- Are you going to tell Robert?	- Are you?	4
- Are you?	- He'll never forgive me.	2

It really hurts, doesn't it?	So much. 	1
- It's surprising, isn't it?	- It was.	1
You're just gonna leave this?	It's not the first house I've walked away from today!	1

But don't you want to be a writer?	Yeah, I-I just never thought about telenovelas.	3
Any ideas, Jane? Because there are no bad ideas here.	What if he makes himself a mask out of, like, mud and twigs?	1
What if he makes himself a mask out of, like, mud and twigs?	Except for yours, Ricky.	6
I don't know if this is what you were looking for, but maybe Santos could be dressed as a beggar?	Huh! 	4
Because it would be unexpected, see? No one would expect him to demean himself like that.	Hmm. Not bad.	4
You seriously expect me to remember your mom's birth sign?	If it was in the e-mail, I'm gonna need you to remember it.	1
