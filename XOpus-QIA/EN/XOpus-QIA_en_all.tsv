Question	Answer	Annotation (Label)
The coast?	Audrey's been telling me about it from her magazines - haven't you, Audrey?	5
Audrey's been telling me about it from her magazines - haven't you, Audrey?	Some Hollywood film star was supposed to have bought it, but no, it's Mr and Mrs Owen.	1
An island? By the sea?	Islands are generally by the sea.	1
And...and this is for a play? In the West End? And will I be credited in the programme?	Ladies and gentlemen!	6
Are you Mr Narracott?	Ain't no-one else holding the sign. 	1
- Justice Wargrave? The honour's all mine, sir.	Retired from justice now. 	1
Are you coming, or not?	Well...shall we?	1
Well...shall we? 	This way, just up here...	1
Sorry, is there a problem?	Well, that's as far as my fee will take me, sir.	1
Did Mrs Owen leave any instructions for me? - I'm the secretary.	- Only to ensure that you were comfortable and had everything you wished for, Miss Claythorne.	4
- Can I help you? Here.	- Oh, too kind.	1
Well, I can't dress her, can I?	Go on.	1
Shock, maybe? Sudden change?	Begging your pardon, madam, I don't know.	4
Are we on time?	Only just.	1
May I show you to the drawing room, sir? Perhaps an aperitif, whilst you await the other guests?	Ah... Mr Davis. You look like a man who could use a drink.	6
Is there something you're looking for, Miss? Because this is the belowstairs, Miss. For staff.	Well, I am staff.	4
We've got off on the wrong foot, haven't we? But you do have very pretty legs. - It would have been remiss not to admire them.	- Mr Lombard... ..you seem to be under the impression that I am a particular kind of woman.	2
A drink, Mr Marston?	Pink gin. Pink as a virgin's blush.	1
Are you a betting man, Lombard?	It depends.	3
So, how about it? A bet?	The odds are too short.	2
We've met before, you know?	Oh, forgive me, my memory is not what it was.	4
Friends of yours, Mr Davis?	Business acquaintances.	2
RAMC, I presume, Dr Armstrong?	That's right.	1
Have they not telephoned?	There's no telephone on the island, Madam.	2
The Owens...Are they fun-loving types?	"Fun-loving"?	5
"Fun-loving"?	Yeah, cos there's something a tad off here.	5
Your car, the Jensen?	Oh, you saw her? Isn't she a beauty?	1
Oh, you saw her? Isn't she a beauty? I honestly can't imagine loving a person as much as I worship and adore the Jensen.	You ran me off the road.	1
You ran me off the road and then you have the temerity to tell me it's my fault?	Careful, old boy. Getting a little red in the face there.	4
Good work, eh?	Rogers, I'm out of cigarettes.	6
Win any?	I loathe this convention - leaving men to their cigars and their "stories".	6
Is it time?	You start serving.	1
Oh... Mrs Rogers? 	- She just took a turn.	6
- A record?	- It's called Swan Song.	1
Miss Claythorne?	Here.	1
Nothing in it, then?	Miss Brady were like family to us.	6
21 men?	I always thought someone would blab.	5
We shouldn't these dignify these accusations with any more debate. - Agreed?	- Certainly.	1
Oh, you were driving, were you? What a surprise(!)	It was jolly bad luck, that's all.	1
- All right? - He's choking!	He's bleeding!	2
Can you come, please? 	She's been dead for some hours.	5
Has Mrs Rogers got worse?	Somewhat. 	1
- Dead?	- Died in her sleep.	1
There are eight, aren't there? Eight figures for the eight people here. Tell me I'm right. Please tell me I'm right!	I'm sure there is a perfectly rational explanation for this.	4
Have you been for a paddle, General?	What are you, Lombard? A mercenary? Gun for hire? A soldier?	6
What are you, Lombard? A mercenary? Gun for hire? A soldier? Not from any army I'd recognise, but still, a soldier of sorts.	You don't need to worry about what I am.	4
There's always a moment, isn't there? Before the attack, the advance, the bombardment, the chaos...A moment of absolute calm.	Listen...	5
Doesn't this feel like that moment?	I was never a man for calm, General.	2
Rupert?	I'm sorry, Agent Flemming can't come to the phone right now.	5
But an Interpol agent-- that's kind of risky, isn't it?	Rupert must've stumbled upon something	1
You actually spoke to Python? You heard the bastard's voice on the phone?	Yeah.	1
So if he's done this before, you must have those other guns?	Yep, six.	1
Can we make that happen?	Rupert Flemming was meeting with someone, so I had Interpol send an image of his laptop.	6
Is it possible he hacked Interpol?	That's what I was thinking.	1
I don't know, some story about terrifying bacteria he found?	But he'd also tell us that if we can't find a lead in the evidence, we have to look for what's missing.	6
Did he show up to the meeting?	"Can't meet today. Too risky. Sorry."	2
He has Python's real name?	Anonymity is everything in the Deep Web. This Darko holds the key to I.D-ing and caging this snake.	4
Are you asking me not to follow orders, Avery?	I am asking you to wait before you do.	4
Hey, isn't that one of your confidential informants?	Fresh!	1
Is your family from Toulouse?	Yeah.	1
I think that's, like, against the law or something, right?	Sorry, Bernie.	1
I'm sorry...are we chasing a ghost?	More like a virtual identity created by a hacker.	2
Do you remember Paris?	Oh...	4
Teddy? Stay with me.	Avery, there's no shooter.	6
Python's certainly living up to his reputation, isn't he?	Pablo Escobar of the Deep Web.	1
Did we have any luck tracking the source of the weapon's remote commands?	It received commands through the Deep Web.	4
An early beta version with no login credentials? It's hardly worth anything.	All right.	1
Text file? Put that up on the screen.	What is that?	5
Did he ever mention the first time he was given the name Python?	He did.	1
Rav--?	I am already on it, D.B.	1
Do you have a photo of Dante?	I used to have a shoe box full of them. But I don't know, I just--It just got too painful. So I... got rid of them a long time ago.	2
Is that my Dante?	You need to step aside--	6
Did you hear that? Can you imagine the amount of pain you've caused this poor woman?	My mom's house. You're in my house.	5
Socially engineering and spying on your own mother? It doesn't get lower than that.	Now, now, Avery Ryan. You have no idea who you're dealing with.	5
My bedroom? You're grasping at straws, Deputy Director Ryan. You have nothing!	A scantily clad model on your wall? That's as close as you ever got to a real girl.	5
You have three sets of sheets folded in your closet, at the ready. Is that because you were still wetting the bed when you were a teenager?	Just shut your mouth!	4
Wait, you-you think Squamata is being hosted here?	Python just let something slip. It is here.	1
So, is that it?	There's only one way to find out.	1
Hey, you be careful with that, okay? It's only the most important piece of hardware I've ever put my hands on.	I understand.	1
Any idea on how Python got that blade into his old bedroom?	Yeah, he RAT-ed his own mom's computer.	1
Are you kidding me?	He would already be slurring his way through some drinking song he just made up.	5
Ah, so that's why you didn't bust me, huh?	I tapped into his accounts. Sutton owes a lot of money.	5
That sounds nice, all right? I appreciate the offer, really, but listen, I don't want to impose.	Listen, for saving your ass, I think I deserve one person at my engagement party who I actually want to talk to.	6
Did you know a Presidential Commission was looking into the attacks?	It's time for us to move.	4
This vigilante believes I deserve to die?	A transport team is en route. I'll call you when they arrive.	5
Did Ressler agree to help?	My people will take you to the jet. From there, you'll fly to Quito.	5
So this all just cover your ass?	I doubt Hitchin agrees with you.	6
Can I give you a bit of advice?	Please.	1
Do you have evidence that the Cabal exists?	Names of Cabal members have been published--	1
Do you believe she's innocent?	My job isn't to determine her guilt or innocence.	4
deadnotalive.org? That's what it's actually called?	Someone with the screen name "Arioch Cain" put a price on her head.	4
Can you take down the site?	It is decentralized, cached on servers all over the world. I take one down, two pop up.	2
Melts in your mouth, does he?	Or my hand. I'm good either way.	1
Tell me, Mr. Buckley, do you believe in love at first sight?	I don't know. I think love is, uh, more of an acquired taste.	4
Have you ever acquired it-- love?	Yeah. Once.	1
Maybe it will be. Who knows, right?	I've loved Asher Sutton since the moment I laid eyes on him. I love everything about him, including his peculiar affinity for collectibles, even at my engagement party.	5
Maybe I wasn't clear how this works, huh?	I told you I'll have it to you by Friday.	5
- You sure?	- Yeah, it's okay.	1
He said it's okay, huh?	I heard him.	1
We're not through here, huh?	Looks like I made a new friend.	6
This is the site creator? You're Gavrilo Princip?	Real name Gavin Delgado.	1
So you don't share Agent Ressler's opinion that she's innocent?	Elizabeth Keen is a Russian sleeper agent. She said as much to Agent Ressler when she scaled the wall of the Russian embassy, admitted that her real name is Masha Rostova, and asked for asylum.	4
You don't believe me? Go try a layer four UDP/TCP in the OSI stacks.	Agent Navabi?	6
You'll what? Hit me with a denial of service attack?	Actually, I was thinking more like millions of repetitive requests.	2
You got yourself into something, right? Tell me what. Let me help you.	Um...What do you know about underground boxing?	5
Russians?	I hired a private detective to see if I could cut a deal. They found pieces of him along the Allegheny. It's never gonna end.	6
Did you just say we'll have to kill her?	Aram, listen to me very carefully. This is what I need you to do.	5
Agent Ressler knows what we're doing, right? I mean, he knows about Agent Keen?	I called, but he's still testifying before the commission.	2
They will come for you, huh?	I'm counting on it.	1
Arioch Cain? 	You?	1
You?	You look like you've seen a ghost.	5
Oh, my God. Is that-- is that blood on your collar?	What have you done?	6
Did you give her too much?	Miss Claythorne, I warned you against becoming hysterical.	5
General, did you move the figures?	- What? 	5
Do you crave attention, Miss Claythorne? Any kind of attention?	- What are you talking about?	2
Shall we just have breakfast?	It was dreadful news about Mrs Rogers.	2
- Gave up on the surgery, then, Doctor?	People do not just die out of nowhere for no reason!	1
- How about I do it?	I'm not being searched like some grubby criminal!	2
Is that true, Judge?	I have had health problems, yes.	1
General, shall we? Just mild sedatives.	As I said.	1
Perhaps you could call me John?	Thank you, John.	1
Ever get the feeling you're being hunted, Tubs?	Stop calling me that.	5
Really? Cos Mr Owen, whoever he may be, knows a lot about us.	Well, not about me.	2
You never touched him?	I wouldn't want to be near one of them dirty bastards.	1
General? Is your suitcase ready?	She died.	6
Bring a couple of chairs, would you?	What's going on?	5
Well, I can't sleep in my room, can I? Me wife.	Yeah, obviously. 	1
Your employer? Your employer is insane.	Be that as it may, I've got nothing else to go to.	5
She killed herself?	Even made the local paper.	1
Marston was given cyanide, though. Wasn't he, Tubs?	- Cyanide? I'm pretty sure of it.	1
What, the judge?	Well-known as a hanging judge.	1
Someone did this?	Well, it weren't no bleedin' accident.	1
I can imagine crossing paths with a doctor... a judge, but someone like Mr Lombard?	Well, we've crossed paths now. 	1
Well, we've crossed paths now. Haven't we?	Mr Lombard, Blore tells me that you have a revolver.	5
He's got a gun?	I carry it everywhere.	1
Is it Mr Owen's voice on the record? Does anybody recognise it?	Are we forgetting about the gun here?	5
Well, she's shut up now, isn't she?	He's the one moving the figures.	6
Can I? I rather enjoy domestic tasks.	They are soothing.	1
You're actually hungry?	That was heavy work...dealing with Rogers.	1
What, Wargrave and Armstrong? 	Mm-hm.	1
And you found it! Or did you? You shrieking like a woman, was that a bit of amateur dramatics, was it?	I did nothing to Rogers. 	2
Well, you WOULD say that, wouldn't you? Just like you'd say that your gun was stolen.	You really are a first-class, five-star, solid gold fucking moron.	5
You like Uncle Hugo, don't you?	I do.	1
Will you be my aunt?	I will.	1
Ready, old thing?	Ready? I don't think Miss Claythorne can hit a ball.	6
Light a fire on the headland, signal for help?	Not in this weather.	2
Even if I did, I wouldn't be killing you all at the same time, would I?	- How do we know that?	4
And nowhere on that does it say anything about a gun, does it, you idiotic, cretinous bastard?	I'll come with you.	6
Is that true?	You really want to stop calling me that.	4
Is that true, Judge?	I had the power to condemn men and women to death for their crimes.	1
Did you watch Edward Seton hang?	I remember Edward Seton, from the newspapers.	4
Stop it, will you? ! Just stop it!	As if we haven't had to put up with you.	6
What, you think I've done something to it? I'm going to go and fetch another bottle that hasn't been opened.	- I need some water.	6
A chandelier in the bedroom?	Well, it's posh people, innit?	1
Shot? - Are you sure?	- Well, look at him!	1
Let this be a lesson to you, all right? Be more discreet. You don't want to end up getting a bloody nose or doing a stretch inside because it's no fun for you lot in the nick. Go on, scarper.	Thank you.	1
And you'll come down for that?	I have to go.	1
If Philip had the gun before now, he would have taken it with you when you went after Armstrong, wouldn't he?	You could have crept out of your room and planted it.	4
Has been from the off, innit? Working it out. Armstrong said that and all.	It's been a long night.	1
Are we dead already?	What?	5
I don't want to spend another night in this house, do you?	(I reckon we're being watched.)	2
You turn your back for a moment and you couldn't catch up with Cyril?	- Hugo, you can't think this...	2
Well... not long now, though, hm?	Why are you doing this?	5
Has she got an address?	Er, yeah.	1
Katie, did you call this lot?	Steven?	4
- We know he needs time, right?	- Renovations?	6
Boss, can I have a word?	Yeah.	1
What if I found a way to fix it? For you to save some face and make some money? Quite a bit of money.	Well, as it happens, I often find that money has an elevating effect on my frame of mind.	6
Where'd you find them, by the way? Inside the body, were they? What, she swallow them?	Do you want them, or what?	5
Do you want them, or what?	Are we being serious, now? You do know what this lot is worth?	5
Are we being serious, now? You do know what this lot is worth?	Yeah.	1
You ever find out who did it?	Look, you've got your money now. What are the chances of you me doing a favour?	5
And this puts it to bed? For good?	Yeah.	1
Do you feel better putting it right?	Did you hurt her?	4
Did you hurt her?	Who?	5
Did you?	Why would I?	4
Megan... ..are you scared of me?	Clearly not.	2
How's work, honey? Things getting better at the office?	Mom, I don't want to talk about that. 	4
No. Really?	I know. About time, right?	1
I know. About time, right?	About time for what?	5
Is it bright in here to you?	That better?	6
Sir? Sir, are you okay? I need ESU at 1298 Horizon Court.	I saw him. He killed Isabel.	5
Any chance that he left any fingerprints?	Unfortunately, it doesn't look like it.	2
Krumitz, you see that?	What?	4
Isabel?	I really miss you guys.	5
Do you remember his face?	I think he turned away.	2
Do you think he might be lying to you?	He's very fragile. I'm not sure that it's all related to this crime. But there's nothing in his behavior or demeanor that indicate to me the he's fabricating his story.	2
You gonna answer that?	Nope. 	2
Can you?	Yeah.	1
Guys?	Oh, yeah.	1
That thing is connected to the Internet?	You are looking at the device that loaded malware on Isabel's laptop.	1
A "buddy," huh?	All right, so Isabel and her boyfriend Ethan used this toy to continue their sexual relationship after she moved to Tampa for work.	6
Ménage à trois?	Every time Isabel and her boyfriend did the deed, this third device came online.	6
Wait, so you're saying... somebody hijacked Isabel's wireless sex signal and was... what, watching?	Well, not exactly.	2
Buying a sex toy was awkward... but the lingerie was totally natural?	Well, now...	4
Brody, I am your brother, okay? I need your help on this one.	I can't help you, Jordan.	2
Wait, Krummy, you seeing this?	That says someone else hacked into Isabel's video-chat program WeDial.	1
Are you kidding me?	Our target can intrude on anyone's video chat around the world.	2
Can you grab one of Tristan Jenkins' toothbrushes and get it to D.B. Russell in the field office? Look, a simple DNA test should tell us if Tristan's our killer.	Yeah, but with ten monitors? I mean, he's probably watching more than just Isabel.	6
Hey, man...You cool?	Yeah.	1
If you were given opportunity to help Francine before she got in trouble, would you have?	I'd have done anything to help her.	1
So, Tristan's doing what? Collecting happy moments from his victims' lives?	My mom and dad are still married.	6
Tristan thinks this collection of random strangers are his loved ones?	To him, they aren't random strangers.	1
But I guess blood and family doesn't mean much of anything to you now?	Look, that is not true, Jordan.	2
You're sure this is everything?	I think so.	1
This happens to you often?	Well, it happened rather famously on your one and only visit to Baker Street.	2
Or do you not recall excoriating me for not stocking your favorite tea?	It won't happen today.	5
Cause that's what you do-- you help people?	I help you... Sherlock.	4
Give me a minute, all right?	Terrorists do not deserve due process.	5
Have you been sitting there since last night? Last night, I came home, you said you were thinking, I went to bed.	You're dressed for work.	5
Are you an expert in neuro-economics?	I mean, compared to an FBI agent, apparently.	3
Would we be right in assuming that one of the stolen computers had the surveillance video on it?	You would.	1
I assume you're at liberty to use more precise descriptives to explain what was stolen?	How much do you know about neuro-economics?	5
Curates?	The program learns what kind of stories you respond to and gives you more of what you want, as a delivery system for favorable narratives.	1
Mr. Holmes?	This rat is quite recently dead.	5
Should we meet them there?	I've got to finish up here, stay in my lane, but if you two want to take off now, that's fine.	4
Good enough?	Whilst it's certainly convenient to investigate from the comfort of one's home, I do find the FBI's team approach a little off-putting.	5
Wait. You actually saw your father?	He came here while you were running errands.	1
Are you okay?	Do I seem otherwise?	4
Do I seem otherwise?	Well, you haven't seen him in what... five years, more?	4
I find the Chinese character suspicious, don't you? Not their national fiber... the marking on this note.	It means "beautiful."	5
So DZ, Dan Zheng, DiplomatDan, they're one and the same?	I think "SpyDan" might be a more accurate moniker.	5
Did China kill to acquire it?	Sorry to keep you waiting.	6
So that would tell us if they were closer?	It's a cell phone tower simulator. It sucks up every signal in a ten-block radius.	4
Excuse me?	This isn't gonna be handled by DC, and it's not gonna be quiet. It's gonna be loud.	5
You're gonna cut us loose now?	I'm sorry. We're in crisis mode here.	1
We have a mobile team rolling at the World Trade Center?	No pings yet, but we got 25 people canvassing.	1
There are seven different state and federal law enforcement agencies hunting this guy, and you think he was on his way to practice his drumming?	There's a subway station beneath that building with access to the 1 train and Columbus Circle, home to the Bernstein Music Conservatory, being the densest concentration of music rehearsal spaces in the city-	1
Did we earn our place?	For now.	3
On my own?	Well, my absence might be a good thing.	1
You find that hard to believe?	I find it hard to believe that charity brought you to a place like this.	3
Is that what Sherlock and I are? Problems?	Heroin is a problem, Joan.	4
That was in the trash?	I assume Mr. Zheng put it there after he copied the research and wiped the surveillance footage of the three murders he committed.	1
Are you at least going to ask him how the computers came to be found on the same block as rehearsal space rented in his name?	Every person in this hemisphere knew Mr. Zheng was your suspect.	5
In my office?	Technically, it's my father's office.	4
No. I mean, it's been a while since my neurology rotation. Should I?	Another test of your ability to compare and contrast.	5
So this guy was especially resistant to propaganda?	They all were. Hundreds of grad students signed up to be guinea pigs.	1
Won't it be more difficult to hasten the demise of the American imperium from behind a pseudonym?	Ah-ah, let's be clear. I never suggested that I become king, only that someone should.	6
Well, how are you in such high spirits with modernity and progressivism eroding the natural order? Do you have some fresh reason for optimism?	Of course.	1
Is that what you'd call us?	You're... kindred spirits. I mean, I'm sure you know your Plato.	4
Because you don't wish to be doxxed as a public servant? I mean, what would your followers think if they realized you suckled at government's teat?	Look, you have the wrong idea.	5
Don't put us against the wall when you get those firing squads going, will you?	You buy Meher as a suspect?	5
You buy Meher as a suspect?	Well, he's ex-military; he's capable.	1
Would you mind running his name at the FBI?	And if they ask why I'm looking?	4
Are you looking into Samuel Meher?	Oh, you get copied on my searches?	5
Oh, you get copied on my searches?	All guest log-ins are monitored. Got to be able to account for your activity.	1
Just keep me in the loop next time, okay?	Sure.	1
I'm sure Mr. Meher would reject the old adage that there's no such thing as bad publicity, hmm?	So, a secret brainwashing program that everyone thinks has fallen into the hands of the Chinese.	6
Is that Tienchi Flower tea?	Mm. It was on my mind today.	1
You're not worried about the cost?	One could argue it was paid long ago.	2
You're the consultants, right? The ones working with Agent Burke?	Samuel Meher said that you were back in town to meet with Senator Shapiro.	5
So that rancid smell isn't impropriety?	It's hákarl.	2
You sure he's not a machine programmed to follow Bureau protocol? I'm sure DARPA has one in the works, along with a panoply of mechanical dogs, sonic pressure shields, cargo transport blimp...	What is it?	5
I know you said there'd be no reason for me to talk, but do you mind if I say that's insane?	You seemed awfully bold, volunteering all of your bank and phone records.	6
It emits a direct blast of low-range sonic waves which vibrate at the same frequency as lung tissue. would you like a demonstration?	The idea is for police to use it on unruly protesters.	5
Did you misplace my number?	Some things are better to discuss in person.	2
French mercenary outfit?	That was November, two years ago, in Mumbai.	6
It was the same in Mumbai?	That such a precise pattern should happen once, much less recur, is highly unlikely.	4
I mean, he was heading the Peru thing, right?	Mmm. 	1
Zyckner Williams?	Mm-hmm. 	1
You think they had him killed?	What we would need would be copies of Mr. Parris's correspondence with Zyckner Williams and e-mails so that we could find out.	5
Do you have a warrant?	We're here as friends, investigating the murder of your employee.	4
Turning over all of our internal deal memos? That kind of exposure, I mean, even under the circumstances, that is a huge ask.	It may only be so much time before the gunman flees the country, gentlemen, so I'll be blunt.	5
Sherlock?	I would prefer a concise text, but if you absolutely must, leave a message.	5
Look, can you blame me for making the most of Sniper Day? It's like a snow day-- we all got sent home after the shooting.	Perhaps your drinking is your way of coping with the guilt.	5
You think I had Ethan killed?	Of course not.	2
Every day?	According to a homeless guy we talked to.	1
He wasn't, by any chance, the first person shot, was he?	Yeah. 	1
You're saying that he had...no such enemies?	He did a lot of jobs down near Wall Street. Tempers flare when there's a delay sometimes, but nobody gets shot over toilets, you know?	4
He did a lot of jobs down near Wall Street. Tempers flare when there's a delay sometimes, but nobody gets shot over toilets, you know?	Perhaps he saw something he wasn't supposed to see while he was working in one of those buildings.	4
Would you mind if I had a look around? I'd also like to see any personal effects that were returned to you by the police.	They're right in the kitchen.	4
Are you suffering from low T?	Excuse me?	4
Is it what's causing this late-onset humanity that you've been exhibiting since your return to New York? Is that why you comforted Mrs. Bova?	Was I such a terrible father that you can't imagine me being kind to a widow?	5
Isn't the more likely explanation that you've never seen me as I am?	Owing to my deficient powers of observation.	5
Would you like to start again?	Listen, I got no reason to believe this story of yours, and I don't like cops.	5
Or have you not noticed that your so-called "baths" are little more than fungal soup?	You do what you need to do. Right now, you need to leave.	5
Shall we say $10,000?	So you do have your phone with you.	5
Nothing else of note?	You guys are welcome to pick through the luggage he was packing, but nothing jumped out at CSU.	2
Is it because he bribed the district attorney to keep me out of prison?	You know about that?	4
You know about that?	It was a difficult pill to swallow, knowing that my absolution was paid for, accepting a literal get-out-of-jail-free card for the beating of Oscar Rankin.	1
Find something?	Yeah.	1
Think it's some sort of code?	I think the last 13 digits are a bank account, and the first seven are a Swiss routing number.	1
Seriously?	As I said, ripe for reconsideration.	1
You didn't tell her?	Didn't seem relevant when I relayed our progress yesterday.	2
And now I'm sitting in what? What do you call this room? Is this the box?	We call it "Interview One." It's just a good, quiet place to talk.	4
I don't see a judge letting that redacted bank paperwork into trial. Do you? I mean, we can't explain how he got it.	Not yet.	2
You want a piece of our offshore business, you want to pair us up with somebody in Ukraine? Because you can forget about us pulling back in the Jordan Valley.	Oh, I'm sure I'll do plenty of business with Dynastic Energy in the future, Bill.	4
You think we'd be better off starting fresh in the morning?	Men require less sleep than women.	2
If Gagnier used an accomplice to plant the gun, do you really think that person's gonna tell us something that we can use against Wellstone?	It's a long shot that such a person would know of Wellstone's involvement.	2
Would you say that was velvet bentgrass?	That I couldn't tell you.	4
That's you on the right, is it not, Mr. Wellstone? And please confirm that you see the time there-- 12:09 p.m. on the day of the attack.	We can all see that's Mr. Wellstone.	1
So you won't mind if I speak with him?	Did you know you had a predecessor, Lukas? At Interpol.	5
It's hard to breathe, isn't it?	- Maybe I'll wash my hair.	6
There are people in my house. Can you believe it? People! Frankie's friends thought it was okay to just drop by.	- Wait, Frankie is still there?	5
- Wait, Frankie is still there?	- I know. Right?	1
- I know. Right?	- Frankie?	6
Now, do you want to vent, you want to scrapbook, you wanna get revenge?	Who told you about Sol?	6
Have you gotten a lawyer yet? Because I know every lawyer in the state.	And she should. She's used most of them.	5
Did everyone know? Was I the only one who didn't?	I was shocked. I swear.	1
- You cut off their credit cards?	- I know. Terrible.	1
Did you hear that? My house. And you know what else? I'm going to hang up on you. God, that felt good.	Frankie? Frankie? You okay? What happened?	5
And do you see a connection as to why she might not reach out to you?	...ish.	3
- Will you look at me, please?	- Excuse me, I'm reading.	2
You're not reading. Popular Woodworking?	I have surprises too, Sol.	1
You're a secret woodworker?	What I hate is that barely a week after you've wrecked my life, you've already moved on to the legal...and to lawyers and... and stopping credit cards...	5
Coyote's out of rehab?	You didn't know?	1
- He's... he's living there?	- Yeah.	1
Seriously? You're really gonna do this right now? You're really gonna make this about you when this is the first time that the four of them have been together since... you know...	Gay-maggedon?	5
Gay-maggedon?	- Arma-gayden? Is that better?	4
- Arma-gayden? Is that better?	- That is better.	1
Was that not implied when I told you I wanted you to pick up the kids?	You said you were going to Frankie's and that I should...Right. Right, that was implied.	1
Okay, anybody up for a drink? Other than the alcoholic?	I am. 	1
Was any of it real?	You're going to make new memories, Frankie.	4
Are these from my baptism?	And mine, too.	1
And did you talk to Rafael?	Lina confirmed, did you get that, Abuela?	5
Lina confirmed, did you get that, Abuela?	- Mm-hmm.	1
- Jane, did you talk to him?	Why? He's the one that asked Michael.	2
- Is this a bad time?	- Shush me, - you dragged me here.	6
This is awkward, okay?	I was playing you.	5
Are any babies blinking back?	Tanner is. 	1
We are on it, right?	♪ Good-bye, Tanner ♪ ♪ Good-bye, Lily ♪ ♪ Good-bye, Mateo... ♪	6
Wait, are you here to see me or Jane?	- Uh, both.	5
Have you even considered a spray tan?	And now we're walking to the front door. And we're seeing...Michael?	6
I'll see you at the baptism rehearsal later?	- Yeah.	1
Hey, are you okay?	How do you find the words to say that your psychotic ex-wife inseminated herself with your stolen sperm?	2
Hey, so is your sister coming to the baptism or... ? She didn't RSVP.	Uh, nope, I have not heard from her.	2
Any of this ring a bell?	I'm sorry, to be honest, I wasn't listening to that call.	4
Remember how we set her up to maker her think I still had feelings for her?	And I think that she'd do anything, even turn in her own mother, if she thought she had a chance with you.	1
You okay?	Yeah. 	1
- Hon, do you remember what you said when you were pregnant?	We need some kind of signal. A way for you to let me know that I'm about to let motherhood hijack my goals.	6
Do you think it's the right move for the show? You know, as an E.P.?	Well, obviously, the fans and the press will go nuts.	1
Is that a figure of speech?	Knock, knock.	6
What's that? Your diary?	It's not a diary. 	2
Really?	I promise.	1
Because you don't want to be with me?	I didn't say that.	4
What's the alternative? We welcome her to the family? Have her over for Thanksgiving?	Used my own turkey baster. Enjoy!	6
And then what, she doesn't tell Mateo he has a sibling until one day he finds out?	Who can I make this out to?	6
You know what? I have enough to worry about with this whole school decision.	- Come on, you're going back.	5
Mm-hmm, and as for matching the handwriting to a name in the visitor log?	Well, it's difficult, due to the ink degradation and wine stains.	5
So, mommies, as we wrap up, is there anything you'd like to share? Where you're at, Where baby's at?	I do, actually, have something to share.	1
I want to work. Does that make me terrible?	Mommies, stop. There's no right choice, because we're all different. The only thing that's important is that you honor whatever choice is right for you.	2
I assume you've read the lines? This is when Blanca reunites with Santos after an agonizing separation.	Let's roll!	5
Are we ready?	- One more thing, Janie.	2
Michael and Lina, as godparents, do you promise to support these parents in raising this child, showering him with wisdom and affection?	- We do.	1
He did?	I didn't tell you, because, well, it seemed so important for you to see it first.	1
Do you think either of us is any less of a mother?	I know, but it's not just that.	5
Do you remember how excited you were when you told us?	We got into grad school!	6
Xiomara, can we talk about what happened, please?	What do you mean?	5
He looks good, doesn't he? He's got, like, a certain glow.	I don't know, he's been so distant lately.	4
Did you really think I would respond to that kind of thing?	- Jane, so listen...	5
- And being distant, and kind of a jerk on purpose?	Jane, I-I'm trying to tell you.	5
Are you okay?	Yeah, I'm fine.	1
But is that what you want?	I don't want any of this.	2
I'm guessing from that reaction, that's what you want?	Thank you.	5
But you want to have this baby?	Well, I don't want you to have an abortion. Or move to Russia.	4
She wants a picture of me? She's outrageous. Do you have any lip gloss?	Wait a minute, if they're trying to get Rose to notice Luisa's missing, then Rose isn't the one who had her kidnapped.	6
Is it true I didn't get the part?	This is not a good time. We are about to shoot a death-defying scene.	5
You think that's more exciting than summer?	Oh, am I stealing your rays, dude?	5
You get that, right?	The current trend in branding is unique, simplistic, phonetically memorable gibberish.	5
How about nipple dippers?	I like nipple dippers.	1
Are you guys going out to celebrate or something? Maybe I'll tag along, it's been a tough year, I could use a drink.	We were gonna to Britta's bar whenever - Oh. Mother time is willing to call it a year.	1
Are you coming back Elroy?	I think so.	1
Are you coming back?	Yeah.	1
She said she had an interview?	Six years. Six seasons, right Abed?	6
Six seasons, right Abed?	Don't put a nickel in him.	5
What if Shirley came back, would that change your disposition?	Shirley could get us back on formula, but I don't see it turning us around.	2
You guys, can we put a pin in the B story and focus on the A story?	I don't trust A stories.	2
Is this combination gonna work?	Not my place to say.	4
Yeah see, Shirley, no Shirley, what does it matter, right?	Abed, we're not formulas, and if I had no self-awareness, I think I'd know.	5
Things have a certain structure to them, you know? If we stray from it, we're weird, if we stick to it, we're boring.	Yeah, but isn't that more about the shape of your brain, Abed? I mean, no offense or anything. But isn't the shape of your brain kinda fucked up?	5
Yeah, but isn't that more about the shape of your brain, Abed? I mean, no offense or anything. But isn't the shape of your brain kinda fucked up?	Hm. 	4
Can I have your bedroom? If you don't come back, if you don't come back.	Well, I'm definitely coming back, probably.	2
Jeff, you okay?	Huh? Oh, I, I was taken aback.	4
Has anyone seen my e-cigarette?	There should be a charity for people like you.	5
Are those last few criminology credits you need hard to get at Greendale?	Please. The only credit that it's hard to get at Greendale is from a bank.	2
You remember the ass crack bandit?	Do I remember? I mean. Doesn't everybody.	1
What is with this diaper thing? Is it about shaming me?	Do you really want a bunch of people dressing you?	5
Do you really want a bunch of people dressing you?	It would be polite to try.	4
You wanna know a perfect season seven?	I can't count the reasons I should stay. One by one, they all just fade away.	6
In this version, will you tell me what to do a lot?	Am I on meds in it? I'm mellow and relatable. I like it.	5
But you're coming back right?	Maybe.	4
Did anything funny happen?	Who cares.	4
Are you okay? 	Is this really what you want?	5
Is this really what you want?	Of course.	1
Are we interrupting?	Stop being gross!	5
Are you guys doing an unauthorized finale in here? Not cool.	Abed, I know it gives you comfort to see everything through that metal lens, but we were just saying goodbye to the room.	2
We can cut to them at home though, right? I mean by ourselves?	Sure.	1
Miss? I have to apologize.	Well, not to me, but I'm sure the Amish are pissed that you're gaying up their look.	6
See the guy in the booth over there? Jared "Leto Himself Go"? He just offered to read my future as my tip!	Ha! You don't have one.	5
I see two Ms?	You bitch! Have you been holding out on MM's?	5
Max, can I have just a wee bite? A crumble of the crumble? Caroline won't let me eat anything because of my big photo shoot.	Hurry! No chewing, no enjoying. Just swallow.	1
He's not eating, is he? I don't want the Stay Puft Marshmallow man showing up at my girlfriend's photo shoot.	I haven't eaten anything since Tuesday!	2
Will I be able to make Max head pastry chef? And where is this new location?	Well, right now, everything's under wraps the way my face was six months ago. But as manager, you can hire your own staff, and I'll even let you poach Max.	4
Max, did you hear that? Major flagship!	Uh, did someone just call me a major flag? I think you did, and if I don't get to go to the new place with you two, I'm telling HR. That's Hector Rodriguez, my therapist.	5
Uh, did someone just call me a major flag? I think you did, and if I don't get to go to the new place with you two, I'm telling HR. That's Hector Rodriguez, my therapist.	Would you be interested in coming to the new High as part of our team?	5
Would you be interested in coming to the new High as part of our team?	If you say "part of our team" again, I'll rethink the whole thing.	4
Can we hurry this along? My cousin is on Maury Povich today, and I wanna find out if he's the father. 'Cause then I can stop paying child support.	Sorry. She's a little amped.	5
Have you seen the Knicks lately? He can only help.	Well, according to my time card, I've been here for six hours already, so I'm gonna head back and catch some Zs.	5
What is this, the Bunny Ranch?	Baby, I think these are yours.	6
Can we just make it a general rule that there's no fornication in the diner?	Or in Han's apartment, ever.	5
How 'bout back to work?	Max and I...	2
Where are you running off to so fast? Is someone having a sale on smaller heads?	I'm too small, I'm too big... pick one!	5
Did Joe tell you about my big new job promotion?	Of course she did. 	1
Aw, no, you saw me in the Today Show window, didn't ya?	You checked into "America" on Facebook, you bleedin' idiot.	2
Who am I, Woody Allen? Roman Polanski? Pretty much any of your big-time '70s movie directors?	You had sex with me innocent child?	5
You had sex with me innocent child?	Uh, not so innocent.	5
Professional? Yesterday, she slapped a woman in here for wearing cheap heels.	I know. My face is still red.	5
Can I keep the hat? You are not gonna want this back. My head sweats like a watermelon at a picnic.	Please don't fire us over the Nash situation. It was out of our hands.	6
Do you really need to expose 60% of your boobs?	It's not up to me. These girls have a life of their own. The right one just started a Fleetwood Mac cover band.	1
He's here? I'll go get him a kid's menu.	They're not coming. His mom found the racy pictures I sent him.	6
"Flying out of JFK tomorrow. Taking the morning Aer Lingus"?	A little morning "Aer Lingus"? Isn't that what got Max in trouble in the first place?	5
A little morning "Aer Lingus"? Isn't that what got Max in trouble in the first place?	Okay, well, we just have to go to the airport and stop them. I'll buy us plane tickets and then return them, like I do with shoes or Tom Cruise does with wives.	4
Miss, will you step over here, please?	Oh, I was kidding. I don't have a bomb. But I have been known to... be DA bomb.	5
May I see your tickets?	 Nice day. I like your hair.	2
You traveling to Paris. First-class. In those jeans?	You got first-class tickets to Paris? Are you insane?	5
You got first-class tickets to Paris? Are you insane?	My fingers did it. It was rich girl cellular memory.	1
Is it too late for me to say I don't know her?	Ma'am, are you carrying any explosives?	5
Ma'am, are you carrying any explosives?	I had leftover Chipotle for breakfast. Does that count?	2
I had leftover Chipotle for breakfast. Does that count?	It does to whoever's sitting next to you.	3
You know what won't be on the plane? Us! We're not going! Have you been smoking the half joint I have hidden in my bra?	You have a joint?	5
You have a joint? Bank account? Ha! You went through security with pot?	I went through third grade with pot.	1
You are just loose as a goose, aren't ya?	Again... when you're right, you're right.	1
Would passenger Maeve O'Brien please report to the gate desk?	Oh, Nash, maybe they're bumping us up from the last coach row to the second to the last coach row!	6
You bribed an airline employee with a joint? Pain? Oh, you really gotta stretch out for that. Max, this is kidnapping.	Oh, he's not that young.	5
What? Here? We're working here? I've got to find out who I brutally murdered in a previous life and make it up to him or her.	This sucks!	1
I'm doing great. Did that sound convincing? 'Cause I've been practicing it in the bathroom mirror for an hour every morning.	I know, I've got to stop sitting on the toilet while you do that.	4
Hello, what are you two talking about? Deciding which tables to ignore?	We're talking about Sophie's taste.	2
Does anyone have a knife?	Max, why do you have a switchblade to work in a dessert bar?	1
Sophie, was your grandma the Crypt Keeper?	What's going on out here?	6
Just mildly? I mean, now I'm getting mad.	Sorry. Wedding drama.	5
So you weren't always into women?	Of course I was. Except those three years in Scientology.	3
Ladies, look around, we'll be back... in about a month. Tahiti anyone? I'm just Crazy Carl. The ladies love it.	Bridesmaid's dresses should be called what they are. Really expensive donations to Goodwill.	5
Max, did you hear me?	My life is over.	1
Max, did you hear that? Someone has worst taste than Sophie. Now we just have to hang back here and let them get to those dresses first. Yay! My life is good again.	Max, Caroline, up here.	5
What was that, like, a second?	I saved you a space upfront.	5
So you're telling me, Versace got murdered, but no one's taken out whoever made these?	I know. I feel like Tweety Bird is gonna sue us for copyright infringement.	1
There's more? 	Oh, if anyone finds a Xanax, it's mine.	6
Sophie, are you sure you don't care?	Oh, yeah. Sure.	1
Listen, crying in a women's dressing room? 	Whoever it is, girl, big butts are in.	5
Are you okay?	It's not me, but I'm okay.	3
She does? Well, then she should say so. Now.	Well, Sophie, I think you have your own unique style.	5
You stuffed Han in the microwave and you're ready to hit power?	Come on. We've tried. You know he doesn't fit. The one thing he's too big for.	2
Wait, it's the Warsaw Times? All this time, I've been thinking it was The New York Times.	New York Times? This is much more exclusive.	1
What was that, like a second?	Yup. You just went from the best of times to The Warsaw Times.	1
Caroline, are we still on for Two Boots pizza tonight? I'm closing the diner early in honor of your birthday, and just not because the city has demanded to look into the black mold situation.	Absolutely, Han.	1
Oh, really? I thought a girl's best friend was someone just a little fatter than her.	It was my grandma's from Russia.	5
Is Sophie expecting it?	Of course. She doesn't like surprises since her family barn was torched by a mentally unstable farmhand.	1
A condom full of hamburger meat?	Oh, my God. Is that a Lamborghini? Wait. Is that my Lamborghini?	6
Oh, my God. Is that a Lamborghini? Wait. Is that my Lamborghini?	Yeah, it's a Lamborghini Aventador Roadster.	1
Can't we have anything?	That's a $450,000 sports car.	5
I always liked you more than Max. You know that, right, girl?	Really? 'Cause yesterday, I heard you yell to Max, "Is Caroline turning 47 or 48? 'Cause she acts like she's 65."	5
They bought you a boy? You were rich.	Oh, boy, the car's right here, and you can't even use it. That's like me having you two for waitresses.	6
Caroline, can I ask you a favor?	You're not using the car to propose to Sophie.	2
But we can still drive it, right? I mean, I've been on that cream for like a month.	Max, what is the ninth rule of the Lamborghini Club?	5
Max, you did it again. You roofied me, didn't you?	Of course I did.	1
Have you got a pen and paper?	You knew I didn't want to do this.	5
You took a $450,000 car, a car we're not even supposed to be touching, on a joyride to the Hamptons?	You wanted to be here.	1
You drove over the dunes and onto the beach?	Not intentionally.	3
Did it get any scratches? Max, get out of the car, and help me look for scratches.	You said you were more fun in the Hamptons.	5
What is "Uh-oh"? Are we stuck in the sand?	You have correctly identified the meaning of "Uh-oh."	1
You know what you are? You are reckless.	You know, all this time, I thought you were a ride-or-die kind of bitch.	5
Are you Googling "Ride-or-die kind of bitch"?	I would be, but I only have two bars.	2
You're hoarding nickels, and I'm walking out of the 99 Cent Store empty-handed? Now I'm mad.	Get ready.	5
What'd you do? Fart us out of the ditch?	Seriously, Caroline, step on it.	5
Should we Thelma and Louise it?	You mean drive over a cliff?	5
Did you girls get the car back in time this morning?	Yep, just in time, thanks to Caroline.	1
You didn't get a ticket? Yesterday, I got arrested for just walking into Whole Foods.	I can't believe I still have sand in my hair.	6
He's proposing at the diner? What's he gonna do? Put an onion ring on it?	I love that. You know, I was planning on saying no and making you beg for a few hours, but...	6
Hello, I'm Murray. Did you order curry in a hurry?	I don't know. Is it paid for?	3
I don't know. Is it paid for?	Yeah.	1
Any samosas in there? 	You want some naan? 'Cause whoever ordered it ain't gettin' naan.	5
Did you guys see Murray with our curry in a hurry?	Nope, sorry.	2
Sophie's phone has a fertility app? My phone's so old it can't get pregnant.	Tells us when she's most fertile. Actually, a little cartoon monkey tells us.	1
What's his name? Overly curious George?	Oleg, it's time. 	6
You mind if I use your stomach as a tray so I can eat while we do it?	Do I ever mind?	2
Do I ever mind?	I have to block out so much now just to get through the day.	6
Okay, Max, this time can you do the blow-it-up hand thing with him? I've tried it, but I'm just not good at hand stuff. Ask anyone at Yale PREP.	Just give it a shot! You also thought you couldn't eat food that's been stepped on.	5
Is there a class I can take?	I'll go get the last of the rent money.	5
So, what kind of name is "Mookie"? Is it short for something? Long for something? Max, hurry up, girl.	Okay, you should have $800 and here's the last of it.	6
You've been overcharging me rent?	It's not like that.	4
And is Max Black even your real name?	It's a real name.	4
Can you just let this go? So I took a little off the top. Everybody takes a little off the top. Look what God did to Han.	Don't drag me into the middle of Pretty Little Liars.	5
Why? So we can be eye level?	Good put-down, Caroline.	2
See, Han? Teamwork.	All right, listen to our latest Yelp reviews.	1
So no one cares that Max has been stealing $25 a month from me?	That's correct.	1
Did you overcharge him too?	You'll all find out where we are soon enough.	6
Oh no, this isn't one of those escape rooms where they lock you in a room and you have to work as a team to get out?	Welcome to the Escape Room, where we lock you in a room, and you have to work as a team to get out.	1
What? Us beating the crap out of you?	Together, of course.	1
Now let me get this straight. Y'all are volunteering to be locked up in a tiny room? See now, that's some white people stuff right there.	It's a fun way for us all to learn how to work together to solve a problem.	1
Do I have to escape from this too? I mean, is this part of the game?	Is this a bad time to tell you your horse masterminded the whole thing?	1
Is this a bad time to tell you your horse masterminded the whole thing?	Before we start, I need to collect your phones so you can't Google answers.	5
This is a work team-building thing and you're not part of the team. Right, Han?	- She can stay.	2
Is this our version of make-up sex?	I can't see a thing!	5
I used to think that. You know where that got me? Pennsylvania, with no car.	Schwarzenegger's is big, Fox's is small.	6
Oh, come on, are you still on the money? Oh, my God, my sister lost both her thumbs in a combine accident and she didn't talk about it this much.	Ah, here's $25. Let's call it hush money, so hush.	6
The fat twins? 'Cause that made no sense and they look like they get stoned a lot.	Okay, Oleg, drop your pants.	5
Can we have a little more class and wait till we get in the cab?	What? We're gonna do it on top of teacups. That's pretty classy.	2
You know what? Spray some of that stuff in my eyes.	Max, look.	6
Are you okay?	Yeah, I think. 	1
I jumped into a floor hole for feelings?	Well, my feelings are really hurt, Max. It's been four years.	1
Can we please turn the lights back off?	Oh, God, help me!	4
- Guess what I did today?	- Hmm?	4
- Did you do your vows?	- Aw, jeez.	2
- A greeting from Hallmark?	- Not listening anymore!	2
You just... let him go to bed?	Well, he was in such a good mood, and he'd never seen Home Alone.	1
- Ooh, is this a party?	- Yeah. You want a muffin?	1
- Guy, can we talk about something?	Hell, yeah.	1
Has anybody ever told you you're a wonderful man?	I think you're telling me that now, right?	4
I think you're telling me that now, right?	Well, you are.	1
Oh, Frankie, Battleship rematch later, huh?	Yeah, um, yeah.	4
Should... Should I come and help you? I know you've been dreading this. Oh, I'll bring my label maker.	Oh, I already have your label maker, and I thought I would dread this, but you know, my boundary work with Sol has been so productive and I'm ready for closure.	2
- You happy, Dad?	- Happy's generous.	2
Is that what happened to my grandmother's little Dutch boy? Hello, Hans.	Oh, yeah. I broke that one.	1
- Right?	Oh, my God.	5
Do you think I should leave them some sage so they can get rid of our juju?	- It's all good.	2
Don't stop, okay?	Aww.	6
Just before you leave, how about we light the Shabbos candle one last time?	- Yeah, yeah.	1
Any good?	It's good, mm-hmm. - It's...	1
It's like a joke, I mean, we're lawyers?	I'm confused. Did you want him to sign this?	5
I'm confused. Did you want him to sign this?	Oh, come on, it's not that bad.	1
You mean here... where you cite precedent?	Mm-hmm.	1
Are you suing him for his love?	I told you it wasn't ready. 	1
- I wrote this?	- You did. Either that, or I'm in love with Sol.	1
Do you understand how this is gonna set her back? Oh, you are such a sh...Such a...	Schmuck? Is that the word you're looking for?	4
- You know where she is?	- Well, I have a feeling.	4
- Are you going to tell Robert?	- Are you?	4
- Are you?	- He'll never forgive me.	2
Your husband tells you he's in love with another man, and you think there's still hope?	I didn't say it made sense.	1
It really hurts, doesn't it?	So much. 	1
- It's surprising, isn't it?	- It was.	1
You're just gonna leave this?	It's not the first house I've walked away from today!	1
That's great. Can I call you back?	What do you mean, "that's great"?	5
I will crush dinner with your mom, okay? And there's someone here.	Oh... oh, yeah, sorry.	1
