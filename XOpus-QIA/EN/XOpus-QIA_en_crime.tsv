Question	Answer	Annotation (Label)
The coast?	Audrey's been telling me about it from her magazines - haven't you, Audrey?	5
Audrey's been telling me about it from her magazines - haven't you, Audrey?	Some Hollywood film star was supposed to have bought it, but no, it's Mr and Mrs Owen.	1
An island? By the sea?	Islands are generally by the sea.	1
And...and this is for a play? In the West End? And will I be credited in the programme?	Ladies and gentlemen!	6
Are you Mr Narracott?	Ain't no-one else holding the sign. 	1
- Justice Wargrave? The honour's all mine, sir.	Retired from justice now. 	1
Are you coming, or not?	Well...shall we?	1
Well...shall we? 	This way, just up here...	1
Sorry, is there a problem?	Well, that's as far as my fee will take me, sir.	1
Did Mrs Owen leave any instructions for me? - I'm the secretary.	- Only to ensure that you were comfortable and had everything you wished for, Miss Claythorne.	4
- Can I help you? Here.	- Oh, too kind.	1
Well, I can't dress her, can I?	Go on.	1
Shock, maybe? Sudden change?	Begging your pardon, madam, I don't know.	4
Are we on time?	Only just.	1
May I show you to the drawing room, sir? Perhaps an aperitif, whilst you await the other guests?	Ah... Mr Davis. You look like a man who could use a drink.	6
Is there something you're looking for, Miss? Because this is the belowstairs, Miss. For staff.	Well, I am staff.	4
We've got off on the wrong foot, haven't we? But you do have very pretty legs. - It would have been remiss not to admire them.	- Mr Lombard... ..you seem to be under the impression that I am a particular kind of woman.	2
A drink, Mr Marston?	Pink gin. Pink as a virgin's blush.	1
Are you a betting man, Lombard?	It depends.	3
So, how about it? A bet?	The odds are too short.	2
We've met before, you know?	Oh, forgive me, my memory is not what it was.	4
Friends of yours, Mr Davis?	Business acquaintances.	2
RAMC, I presume, Dr Armstrong?	That's right.	1
Have they not telephoned?	There's no telephone on the island, Madam.	2
The Owens...Are they fun-loving types?	"Fun-loving"?	5
"Fun-loving"?	Yeah, cos there's something a tad off here.	5
Your car, the Jensen?	Oh, you saw her? Isn't she a beauty?	1
Oh, you saw her? Isn't she a beauty? I honestly can't imagine loving a person as much as I worship and adore the Jensen.	You ran me off the road.	1
You ran me off the road and then you have the temerity to tell me it's my fault?	Careful, old boy. Getting a little red in the face there.	4
Good work, eh?	Rogers, I'm out of cigarettes.	6
Win any?	I loathe this convention - leaving men to their cigars and their "stories".	6
Is it time?	You start serving.	1
Oh... Mrs Rogers? 	- She just took a turn.	6
- A record?	- It's called Swan Song.	1
Miss Claythorne?	Here.	1
Nothing in it, then?	Miss Brady were like family to us.	6
21 men?	I always thought someone would blab.	5
We shouldn't these dignify these accusations with any more debate. - Agreed?	- Certainly.	1
Oh, you were driving, were you? What a surprise(!)	It was jolly bad luck, that's all.	1
- All right? - He's choking!	He's bleeding!	2
Can you come, please? 	She's been dead for some hours.	5
Has Mrs Rogers got worse?	Somewhat. 	1
- Dead?	- Died in her sleep.	1
There are eight, aren't there? Eight figures for the eight people here. Tell me I'm right. Please tell me I'm right!	I'm sure there is a perfectly rational explanation for this.	4
Have you been for a paddle, General?	What are you, Lombard? A mercenary? Gun for hire? A soldier?	6
What are you, Lombard? A mercenary? Gun for hire? A soldier? Not from any army I'd recognise, but still, a soldier of sorts.	You don't need to worry about what I am.	4
There's always a moment, isn't there? Before the attack, the advance, the bombardment, the chaos...A moment of absolute calm.	Listen...	5
Doesn't this feel like that moment?	I was never a man for calm, General.	2
Rupert?	I'm sorry, Agent Flemming can't come to the phone right now.	5
But an Interpol agent-- that's kind of risky, isn't it?	Rupert must've stumbled upon something	1
You actually spoke to Python? You heard the bastard's voice on the phone?	Yeah.	1
So if he's done this before, you must have those other guns?	Yep, six.	1
Can we make that happen?	Rupert Flemming was meeting with someone, so I had Interpol send an image of his laptop.	6
Is it possible he hacked Interpol?	That's what I was thinking.	1
I don't know, some story about terrifying bacteria he found?	But he'd also tell us that if we can't find a lead in the evidence, we have to look for what's missing.	6
Did he show up to the meeting?	"Can't meet today. Too risky. Sorry."	2
He has Python's real name?	Anonymity is everything in the Deep Web. This Darko holds the key to I.D-ing and caging this snake.	4
Are you asking me not to follow orders, Avery?	I am asking you to wait before you do.	4
Hey, isn't that one of your confidential informants?	Fresh!	1
Is your family from Toulouse?	Yeah.	1
I think that's, like, against the law or something, right?	Sorry, Bernie.	1
I'm sorry...are we chasing a ghost?	More like a virtual identity created by a hacker.	2
Do you remember Paris?	Oh...	4
Teddy? Stay with me.	Avery, there's no shooter.	6
Python's certainly living up to his reputation, isn't he?	Pablo Escobar of the Deep Web.	1
Did we have any luck tracking the source of the weapon's remote commands?	It received commands through the Deep Web.	4
An early beta version with no login credentials? It's hardly worth anything.	All right.	1
Text file? Put that up on the screen.	What is that?	5
Did he ever mention the first time he was given the name Python?	He did.	1
Rav--?	I am already on it, D.B.	1
Do you have a photo of Dante?	I used to have a shoe box full of them. But I don't know, I just--It just got too painful. So I... got rid of them a long time ago.	2
Is that my Dante?	You need to step aside--	6
Did you hear that? Can you imagine the amount of pain you've caused this poor woman?	My mom's house. You're in my house.	5
Socially engineering and spying on your own mother? It doesn't get lower than that.	Now, now, Avery Ryan. You have no idea who you're dealing with.	5
My bedroom? You're grasping at straws, Deputy Director Ryan. You have nothing!	A scantily clad model on your wall? That's as close as you ever got to a real girl.	5
You have three sets of sheets folded in your closet, at the ready. Is that because you were still wetting the bed when you were a teenager?	Just shut your mouth!	4
Wait, you-you think Squamata is being hosted here?	Python just let something slip. It is here.	1
So, is that it?	There's only one way to find out.	1
Hey, you be careful with that, okay? It's only the most important piece of hardware I've ever put my hands on.	I understand.	1
Any idea on how Python got that blade into his old bedroom?	Yeah, he RAT-ed his own mom's computer.	1
Are you kidding me?	He would already be slurring his way through some drinking song he just made up.	5
Ah, so that's why you didn't bust me, huh?	I tapped into his accounts. Sutton owes a lot of money.	5
That sounds nice, all right? I appreciate the offer, really, but listen, I don't want to impose.	Listen, for saving your ass, I think I deserve one person at my engagement party who I actually want to talk to.	6
Did you know a Presidential Commission was looking into the attacks?	It's time for us to move.	4
This vigilante believes I deserve to die?	A transport team is en route. I'll call you when they arrive.	5
Did Ressler agree to help?	My people will take you to the jet. From there, you'll fly to Quito.	5
So this all just cover your ass?	I doubt Hitchin agrees with you.	6
Can I give you a bit of advice?	Please.	1
Do you have evidence that the Cabal exists?	Names of Cabal members have been published--	1
Do you believe she's innocent?	My job isn't to determine her guilt or innocence.	4
deadnotalive.org? That's what it's actually called?	Someone with the screen name "Arioch Cain" put a price on her head.	4
Can you take down the site?	It is decentralized, cached on servers all over the world. I take one down, two pop up.	2
Melts in your mouth, does he?	Or my hand. I'm good either way.	1
Tell me, Mr. Buckley, do you believe in love at first sight?	I don't know. I think love is, uh, more of an acquired taste.	4
Have you ever acquired it-- love?	Yeah. Once.	1
Maybe it will be. Who knows, right?	I've loved Asher Sutton since the moment I laid eyes on him. I love everything about him, including his peculiar affinity for collectibles, even at my engagement party.	5
Maybe I wasn't clear how this works, huh?	I told you I'll have it to you by Friday.	5
- You sure?	- Yeah, it's okay.	1
He said it's okay, huh?	I heard him.	1
We're not through here, huh?	Looks like I made a new friend.	6
This is the site creator? You're Gavrilo Princip?	Real name Gavin Delgado.	1
So you don't share Agent Ressler's opinion that she's innocent?	Elizabeth Keen is a Russian sleeper agent. She said as much to Agent Ressler when she scaled the wall of the Russian embassy, admitted that her real name is Masha Rostova, and asked for asylum.	4
You don't believe me? Go try a layer four UDP/TCP in the OSI stacks.	Agent Navabi?	6
You'll what? Hit me with a denial of service attack?	Actually, I was thinking more like millions of repetitive requests.	2
You got yourself into something, right? Tell me what. Let me help you.	Um...What do you know about underground boxing?	5
Russians?	I hired a private detective to see if I could cut a deal. They found pieces of him along the Allegheny. It's never gonna end.	6
Did you just say we'll have to kill her?	Aram, listen to me very carefully. This is what I need you to do.	5
Agent Ressler knows what we're doing, right? I mean, he knows about Agent Keen?	I called, but he's still testifying before the commission.	2
They will come for you, huh?	I'm counting on it.	1
Arioch Cain? 	You?	1
You?	You look like you've seen a ghost.	5
Oh, my God. Is that-- is that blood on your collar?	What have you done?	6
Did you give her too much?	Miss Claythorne, I warned you against becoming hysterical.	5
General, did you move the figures?	- What? 	5
Do you crave attention, Miss Claythorne? Any kind of attention?	- What are you talking about?	2
Shall we just have breakfast?	It was dreadful news about Mrs Rogers.	2
- Gave up on the surgery, then, Doctor?	People do not just die out of nowhere for no reason!	1
- How about I do it?	I'm not being searched like some grubby criminal!	2
Is that true, Judge?	I have had health problems, yes.	1
General, shall we? Just mild sedatives.	As I said.	1
Perhaps you could call me John?	Thank you, John.	1
Ever get the feeling you're being hunted, Tubs?	Stop calling me that.	5
Really? Cos Mr Owen, whoever he may be, knows a lot about us.	Well, not about me.	2
You never touched him?	I wouldn't want to be near one of them dirty bastards.	1
General? Is your suitcase ready?	She died.	6
Bring a couple of chairs, would you?	What's going on?	5
Well, I can't sleep in my room, can I? Me wife.	Yeah, obviously. 	1
Your employer? Your employer is insane.	Be that as it may, I've got nothing else to go to.	5
She killed herself?	Even made the local paper.	1
Marston was given cyanide, though. Wasn't he, Tubs?	- Cyanide? I'm pretty sure of it.	1
What, the judge?	Well-known as a hanging judge.	1
Someone did this?	Well, it weren't no bleedin' accident.	1
I can imagine crossing paths with a doctor... a judge, but someone like Mr Lombard?	Well, we've crossed paths now. 	1
Well, we've crossed paths now. Haven't we?	Mr Lombard, Blore tells me that you have a revolver.	5
He's got a gun?	I carry it everywhere.	1
Is it Mr Owen's voice on the record? Does anybody recognise it?	Are we forgetting about the gun here?	5
Well, she's shut up now, isn't she?	He's the one moving the figures.	6
Can I? I rather enjoy domestic tasks.	They are soothing.	1
You're actually hungry?	That was heavy work...dealing with Rogers.	1
What, Wargrave and Armstrong? 	Mm-hm.	1
And you found it! Or did you? You shrieking like a woman, was that a bit of amateur dramatics, was it?	I did nothing to Rogers. 	2
Well, you WOULD say that, wouldn't you? Just like you'd say that your gun was stolen.	You really are a first-class, five-star, solid gold fucking moron.	5
You like Uncle Hugo, don't you?	I do.	1
Will you be my aunt?	I will.	1
Ready, old thing?	Ready? I don't think Miss Claythorne can hit a ball.	6
Light a fire on the headland, signal for help?	Not in this weather.	2
Even if I did, I wouldn't be killing you all at the same time, would I?	- How do we know that?	4
And nowhere on that does it say anything about a gun, does it, you idiotic, cretinous bastard?	I'll come with you.	6
Is that true?	You really want to stop calling me that.	4
Is that true, Judge?	I had the power to condemn men and women to death for their crimes.	1
Did you watch Edward Seton hang?	I remember Edward Seton, from the newspapers.	4
Stop it, will you? ! Just stop it!	As if we haven't had to put up with you.	6
What, you think I've done something to it? I'm going to go and fetch another bottle that hasn't been opened.	- I need some water.	6
A chandelier in the bedroom?	Well, it's posh people, innit?	1
Shot? - Are you sure?	- Well, look at him!	1
Let this be a lesson to you, all right? Be more discreet. You don't want to end up getting a bloody nose or doing a stretch inside because it's no fun for you lot in the nick. Go on, scarper.	Thank you.	1
And you'll come down for that?	I have to go.	1
If Philip had the gun before now, he would have taken it with you when you went after Armstrong, wouldn't he?	You could have crept out of your room and planted it.	4
Has been from the off, innit? Working it out. Armstrong said that and all.	It's been a long night.	1
Are we dead already?	What?	5
I don't want to spend another night in this house, do you?	(I reckon we're being watched.)	2
You turn your back for a moment and you couldn't catch up with Cyril?	- Hugo, you can't think this...	2
Well... not long now, though, hm?	Why are you doing this?	5
Has she got an address?	Er, yeah.	1
Katie, did you call this lot?	Steven?	4
- We know he needs time, right?	- Renovations?	6
Boss, can I have a word?	Yeah.	1
What if I found a way to fix it? For you to save some face and make some money? Quite a bit of money.	Well, as it happens, I often find that money has an elevating effect on my frame of mind.	6
Where'd you find them, by the way? Inside the body, were they? What, she swallow them?	Do you want them, or what?	5
Do you want them, or what?	Are we being serious, now? You do know what this lot is worth?	5
Are we being serious, now? You do know what this lot is worth?	Yeah.	1
You ever find out who did it?	Look, you've got your money now. What are the chances of you me doing a favour?	5
And this puts it to bed? For good?	Yeah.	1
Do you feel better putting it right?	Did you hurt her?	4
Did you hurt her?	Who?	5
Did you?	Why would I?	4
Megan... ..are you scared of me?	Clearly not.	2
How's work, honey? Things getting better at the office?	Mom, I don't want to talk about that. 	4
No. Really?	I know. About time, right?	1
I know. About time, right?	About time for what?	5
Is it bright in here to you?	That better?	6
Sir? Sir, are you okay? I need ESU at 1298 Horizon Court.	I saw him. He killed Isabel.	5
Any chance that he left any fingerprints?	Unfortunately, it doesn't look like it.	2
Krumitz, you see that?	What?	4
Isabel?	I really miss you guys.	5
Do you remember his face?	I think he turned away.	2
Do you think he might be lying to you?	He's very fragile. I'm not sure that it's all related to this crime. But there's nothing in his behavior or demeanor that indicate to me the he's fabricating his story.	2
You gonna answer that?	Nope. 	2
Can you?	Yeah.	1
Guys?	Oh, yeah.	1
That thing is connected to the Internet?	You are looking at the device that loaded malware on Isabel's laptop.	1
A "buddy," huh?	All right, so Isabel and her boyfriend Ethan used this toy to continue their sexual relationship after she moved to Tampa for work.	6
Ménage à trois?	Every time Isabel and her boyfriend did the deed, this third device came online.	6
Wait, so you're saying... somebody hijacked Isabel's wireless sex signal and was... what, watching?	Well, not exactly.	2
Buying a sex toy was awkward... but the lingerie was totally natural?	Well, now...	4
Brody, I am your brother, okay? I need your help on this one.	I can't help you, Jordan.	2
Wait, Krummy, you seeing this?	That says someone else hacked into Isabel's video-chat program WeDial.	1
Are you kidding me?	Our target can intrude on anyone's video chat around the world.	2
Can you grab one of Tristan Jenkins' toothbrushes and get it to D.B. Russell in the field office? Look, a simple DNA test should tell us if Tristan's our killer.	Yeah, but with ten monitors? I mean, he's probably watching more than just Isabel.	6
Hey, man...You cool?	Yeah.	1
If you were given opportunity to help Francine before she got in trouble, would you have?	I'd have done anything to help her.	1
So, Tristan's doing what? Collecting happy moments from his victims' lives?	My mom and dad are still married.	6
Tristan thinks this collection of random strangers are his loved ones?	To him, they aren't random strangers.	1
But I guess blood and family doesn't mean much of anything to you now?	Look, that is not true, Jordan.	2
You're sure this is everything?	I think so.	1
This happens to you often?	Well, it happened rather famously on your one and only visit to Baker Street.	2
Or do you not recall excoriating me for not stocking your favorite tea?	It won't happen today.	5
Cause that's what you do-- you help people?	I help you... Sherlock.	4
Give me a minute, all right?	Terrorists do not deserve due process.	5
Have you been sitting there since last night? Last night, I came home, you said you were thinking, I went to bed.	You're dressed for work.	5
Are you an expert in neuro-economics?	I mean, compared to an FBI agent, apparently.	3
Would we be right in assuming that one of the stolen computers had the surveillance video on it?	You would.	1
I assume you're at liberty to use more precise descriptives to explain what was stolen?	How much do you know about neuro-economics?	5
Curates?	The program learns what kind of stories you respond to and gives you more of what you want, as a delivery system for favorable narratives.	1
Mr. Holmes?	This rat is quite recently dead.	5
Should we meet them there?	I've got to finish up here, stay in my lane, but if you two want to take off now, that's fine.	4
Good enough?	Whilst it's certainly convenient to investigate from the comfort of one's home, I do find the FBI's team approach a little off-putting.	5
Wait. You actually saw your father?	He came here while you were running errands.	1
Are you okay?	Do I seem otherwise?	4
Do I seem otherwise?	Well, you haven't seen him in what... five years, more?	4
I find the Chinese character suspicious, don't you? Not their national fiber... the marking on this note.	It means "beautiful."	5
So DZ, Dan Zheng, DiplomatDan, they're one and the same?	I think "SpyDan" might be a more accurate moniker.	5
Did China kill to acquire it?	Sorry to keep you waiting.	6
So that would tell us if they were closer?	It's a cell phone tower simulator. It sucks up every signal in a ten-block radius.	4
Excuse me?	This isn't gonna be handled by DC, and it's not gonna be quiet. It's gonna be loud.	5
You're gonna cut us loose now?	I'm sorry. We're in crisis mode here.	1
We have a mobile team rolling at the World Trade Center?	No pings yet, but we got 25 people canvassing.	1
There are seven different state and federal law enforcement agencies hunting this guy, and you think he was on his way to practice his drumming?	There's a subway station beneath that building with access to the 1 train and Columbus Circle, home to the Bernstein Music Conservatory, being the densest concentration of music rehearsal spaces in the city-	1
Did we earn our place?	For now.	3
On my own?	Well, my absence might be a good thing.	1
You find that hard to believe?	I find it hard to believe that charity brought you to a place like this.	3
Is that what Sherlock and I are? Problems?	Heroin is a problem, Joan.	4
That was in the trash?	I assume Mr. Zheng put it there after he copied the research and wiped the surveillance footage of the three murders he committed.	1
Are you at least going to ask him how the computers came to be found on the same block as rehearsal space rented in his name?	Every person in this hemisphere knew Mr. Zheng was your suspect.	5
In my office?	Technically, it's my father's office.	4
No. I mean, it's been a while since my neurology rotation. Should I?	Another test of your ability to compare and contrast.	5
So this guy was especially resistant to propaganda?	They all were. Hundreds of grad students signed up to be guinea pigs.	1
Won't it be more difficult to hasten the demise of the American imperium from behind a pseudonym?	Ah-ah, let's be clear. I never suggested that I become king, only that someone should.	6
Well, how are you in such high spirits with modernity and progressivism eroding the natural order? Do you have some fresh reason for optimism?	Of course.	1
Is that what you'd call us?	You're... kindred spirits. I mean, I'm sure you know your Plato.	4
Because you don't wish to be doxxed as a public servant? I mean, what would your followers think if they realized you suckled at government's teat?	Look, you have the wrong idea.	5
Don't put us against the wall when you get those firing squads going, will you?	You buy Meher as a suspect?	5
You buy Meher as a suspect?	Well, he's ex-military; he's capable.	1
Would you mind running his name at the FBI?	And if they ask why I'm looking?	4
Are you looking into Samuel Meher?	Oh, you get copied on my searches?	5
Oh, you get copied on my searches?	All guest log-ins are monitored. Got to be able to account for your activity.	1
Just keep me in the loop next time, okay?	Sure.	1
I'm sure Mr. Meher would reject the old adage that there's no such thing as bad publicity, hmm?	So, a secret brainwashing program that everyone thinks has fallen into the hands of the Chinese.	6
Is that Tienchi Flower tea?	Mm. It was on my mind today.	1
You're not worried about the cost?	One could argue it was paid long ago.	2
You're the consultants, right? The ones working with Agent Burke?	Samuel Meher said that you were back in town to meet with Senator Shapiro.	5
So that rancid smell isn't impropriety?	It's hákarl.	2
You sure he's not a machine programmed to follow Bureau protocol? I'm sure DARPA has one in the works, along with a panoply of mechanical dogs, sonic pressure shields, cargo transport blimp...	What is it?	5
I know you said there'd be no reason for me to talk, but do you mind if I say that's insane?	You seemed awfully bold, volunteering all of your bank and phone records.	6
It emits a direct blast of low-range sonic waves which vibrate at the same frequency as lung tissue. would you like a demonstration?	The idea is for police to use it on unruly protesters.	5
Did you misplace my number?	Some things are better to discuss in person.	2
French mercenary outfit?	That was November, two years ago, in Mumbai.	6
It was the same in Mumbai?	That such a precise pattern should happen once, much less recur, is highly unlikely.	4
I mean, he was heading the Peru thing, right?	Mmm. 	1
Zyckner Williams?	Mm-hmm. 	1
You think they had him killed?	What we would need would be copies of Mr. Parris's correspondence with Zyckner Williams and e-mails so that we could find out.	5
Do you have a warrant?	We're here as friends, investigating the murder of your employee.	4
Turning over all of our internal deal memos? That kind of exposure, I mean, even under the circumstances, that is a huge ask.	It may only be so much time before the gunman flees the country, gentlemen, so I'll be blunt.	5
Sherlock?	I would prefer a concise text, but if you absolutely must, leave a message.	5
Look, can you blame me for making the most of Sniper Day? It's like a snow day-- we all got sent home after the shooting.	Perhaps your drinking is your way of coping with the guilt.	5
You think I had Ethan killed?	Of course not.	2
Every day?	According to a homeless guy we talked to.	1
He wasn't, by any chance, the first person shot, was he?	Yeah. 	1
You're saying that he had...no such enemies?	He did a lot of jobs down near Wall Street. Tempers flare when there's a delay sometimes, but nobody gets shot over toilets, you know?	4
He did a lot of jobs down near Wall Street. Tempers flare when there's a delay sometimes, but nobody gets shot over toilets, you know?	Perhaps he saw something he wasn't supposed to see while he was working in one of those buildings.	4
Would you mind if I had a look around? I'd also like to see any personal effects that were returned to you by the police.	They're right in the kitchen.	4
Are you suffering from low T?	Excuse me?	4
Is it what's causing this late-onset humanity that you've been exhibiting since your return to New York? Is that why you comforted Mrs. Bova?	Was I such a terrible father that you can't imagine me being kind to a widow?	5
Isn't the more likely explanation that you've never seen me as I am?	Owing to my deficient powers of observation.	5
Would you like to start again?	Listen, I got no reason to believe this story of yours, and I don't like cops.	5
Or have you not noticed that your so-called "baths" are little more than fungal soup?	You do what you need to do. Right now, you need to leave.	5
Shall we say $10,000?	So you do have your phone with you.	5
Nothing else of note?	You guys are welcome to pick through the luggage he was packing, but nothing jumped out at CSU.	2
Is it because he bribed the district attorney to keep me out of prison?	You know about that?	4
You know about that?	It was a difficult pill to swallow, knowing that my absolution was paid for, accepting a literal get-out-of-jail-free card for the beating of Oscar Rankin.	1
Find something?	Yeah.	1
Think it's some sort of code?	I think the last 13 digits are a bank account, and the first seven are a Swiss routing number.	1
Seriously?	As I said, ripe for reconsideration.	1
You didn't tell her?	Didn't seem relevant when I relayed our progress yesterday.	2
And now I'm sitting in what? What do you call this room? Is this the box?	We call it "Interview One." It's just a good, quiet place to talk.	4
I don't see a judge letting that redacted bank paperwork into trial. Do you? I mean, we can't explain how he got it.	Not yet.	2
You want a piece of our offshore business, you want to pair us up with somebody in Ukraine? Because you can forget about us pulling back in the Jordan Valley.	Oh, I'm sure I'll do plenty of business with Dynastic Energy in the future, Bill.	4
You think we'd be better off starting fresh in the morning?	Men require less sleep than women.	2
If Gagnier used an accomplice to plant the gun, do you really think that person's gonna tell us something that we can use against Wellstone?	It's a long shot that such a person would know of Wellstone's involvement.	2

That's you on the right, is it not, Mr. Wellstone? And please confirm that you see the time there-- 12:09 p.m. on the day of the attack.	We can all see that's Mr. Wellstone.	1
So you won't mind if I speak with him?	Did you know you had a predecessor, Lukas? At Interpol.	5
